# Project Description
An arbitrable payment protocol on L2

# Vision and Mission
SilkPay is a payment protocol on L2, which aims to solve problems in various payment scenarios on the basis of low cost and high efficiency, such as prepayment, regular payment, credit payment, etc. We have introduced an arbitration mechanism to resolve payment disputes, and we will also use zk technology to protect privacy during payment and arbitration in the future

# Advantages
- Uniqueness: 
  - We create a universal platform for advance payment, arbitration and split payment. 
  - Embedded Zero Knowledge proof tools to make sure court evidence upon submission is kept secret.
  - During voting, we also keep all onchain users anonymous by using ZK technology.
  - Also we use L2 to leverage our platform to complex computation more affordable. 
- Efficiency:
  - By using pre-payment protocols, we bundle up transactions into batches to save gas fees.
- Security:
  - We set the payment amount and whitelist receivers ahead of time before the payment is triggered, to prevent loss of funds.

# How it works

# Application Scenario
- payments in DAOs, such as the payment of remuneration
- payments in hackathons, such as designating the winner among the contestants and paying out the prize money
- and so on

# Functions completed during hackathon delivery
- [*] **Complete the logic of prepayment**
- [*] **Complete the logic of the arbitration mechanism**

# Further Improvements
- [ ] **Implement the logic of splitBill**
- [ ] **Support batch payment and ERC20 token payment**
- [ ] **Use zk technology to protect the privacy of payment and arbitration**
