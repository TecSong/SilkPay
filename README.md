# Project Description
An arbitrable payment protocol on L2

# Vision and Mission
Primarily, SilkPay aims at bringing faster arbitration solutions to L2, during which, we used different types of L2 platforms, integrated advance payment, arbitration protocols and ZK protocols all to our service, to make better user experience.

# Advantages
- Uniqueness: 
  - We create a universal platform for advance payment, arbitration and split payment. 
  - Embedded Zero Knowledge proof tools to make sure court evidence upon submission is kept secret.
  - During voting, we also keep all onchain users anonymous by using ZK technology.
  - Also we use L2 to leverage our platform to complex computation more affordable. 
- Efficiency:
  - By using pre-payment protocols, we bundle up transactions into batches to save gas fees.
- Security:
  - We set the payment amount and whitelist receivers ahead of time before the payment is triggered, to prevent loss of funds.
