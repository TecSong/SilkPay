# Basic Information

- smart contract deploy:
  - bsc chain: 0x

# Project Description
SilkPay is a payment protocol, which aims to solve problems in various payment scenarios on the basis of low cost and high efficiency solutions, including prepayment,regular payment and more. We also introduce an arbitration mechanism to resolve payment disputes, and we will also use zk technology to protect privacy during payment and arbitration in the future.

# Advantages
- Uniqueness: 
  - We create a universal platform for advance payment, arbitration and split payment. 
  - Embedded Zero Knowledge proof tools to make sure court evidence upon submission is kept secret.
  - During voting, we also keep all onchain users anonymous by using ZK technology.
  - We use arbitration mechanisms to ensure fairness in payment for both parties
- Security:
  - We set the payment amount and whitelist receivers ahead of time before the payment is triggered, to prevent loss of funds.

# Application Scenario
- payments in DAOs, such as the payment of remuneration
- payments in hackathons, such as designating the winner among the contestants and paying out the prize money
- Prize-winning activity and so on

# Functions completed during hackathon delivery
- [ ] **Complete the logic of pre-payment**
- [ ] **Complete the logic of the arbitration mechanism**
- [ ] **suport ERC20 token payment**
    
# Further Improvements
- [ ] **Implement the logic for spliting bills**
- [ ] **Support batch payment**
- [ ] **Use ZK technology to protect the privacy of payment and arbitration**
